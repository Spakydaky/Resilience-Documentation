Creating your savings
----------------

To start you'll be asked to create an account with us to keep your information secure, where you'll need to input your name, email, minimum balance and create your own password. Your minimum balance will be important and its the very lowest value you want your balance to be able to reach. Using this the app will give you warnings about when you're nearing your limit and, of course, when you hit said limit.

after this you'll be able to login with your newly created email and password from the login screen you'll be directed to, and be greeted with the home page. If you've never used the app before you'll be directed to the :doc:`Adding Transactions` page to start saving.
