Transactions
===================================


Adding a Transaction
---------------------
To get started in your budegting journey, you have to add transactions, you do this by clicking the little "+" in the bottom right of your screen. Once on the transaction manager page you press the "+" one more time in order to get creating your own incomes and expenses. A window will pop up allowing you to input a *Category*, a *Description* and a *Value* for your transaction. 

Category
`````````
In the *Category* field you enter what you spent the money or where the money is coming in from. For example "Entertainment", "Eating Out", "Income", "Transfer" and this data will be used to provide insights into your spending habits, as well as help you quickly narrow down to specific transactions. Transactions *must* have a category.

Description
````````````
The *Description* field allows you to make notes about the transactiion. This can be whatever you need or want it to be in order to help you better remember perhaps, or maybe to distinguish between similar transactions. The choice is yours, and remember transactions *require* descriptions too.

Value
``````
The value field is simple, it's the amount going to/from your account. The value *must* be prefixed with either a "+" for money coming in, or a "-" for money coming out, and it *must not* have a currency symbol.

Dates
``````
You'll notice there's a date too! If you want to make a transaction for the past simply press the date and change it to the one you desire. The date is set to the current date and time by default.

Managing Your Transactions
--------------------------

To make changes to your transactions whether thats editing or deleting you'll first need to be on the *Your Transactions* page. Getting there from the dahsboard (where your balance shows) is a matter of simply pressing the blue "+" in the bottom right hand side of your screen, the same as if you were going to add a new transaction. Once on the *Your Transactions* page, scroll to find the transaction you want to edit or delete and press on it. Two options will show in a widget, edit or delete.

* Change the details of the transaction however you wish.
* Press save changes.
