Transactions
===================================

To get started in your budegting journey, you have to add transactions, you do this by clicking the little "+" in the bottom right of your screen. Once on the transaction manager page you press the "+" one more time in order to get creating your own incomes and expenses. A window will pop up allowing you to input a *Category*, a *Description* and a *Value* for your transaction. 

Category
---------

In the *Category* field you enter what you spent the money or where the money is coming in from. For example "Entertainment", "Eating Out", "Income", "Transfer" and this data will be used to provide insights into your spending habits, as well as help you quickly narrow down to specific transactions. Transactions *must* have a category.

Description
------------

The *Description* field allows you to make notes about the transactiion. This can be whatever you need or want it to be in order to help you better remember perhaps, or maybe to distinguish between similar transactions. The choice is yours, and remember transactions *require* descriptions, so feel free to leave it blank if you want.

Value
-------

The value field is simple, its the amount going to/from your account. The value *must* be prefixed with either a "+" for money coming in, or a "-" for money coming out.

Dates
-------

You'll notice theres a date too! If you want to make a transaction for the past simply press the date and change it to the one you desire. The date is set to the current date and time by default.
